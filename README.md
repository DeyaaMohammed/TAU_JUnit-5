## Introduction

The "[JUnit 5](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/junit5-tutorial/)" Course on Test Automation University is a valuable resource for mastering JUnit 5 for effective test automation in Java. This repository contains my implementations of code from each lecture and solutions to the quizzes presented throughout the course.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Chapter X/`: Each lecture from the course has its own directory.
  - `junit5-tutorial/`
    - `src/`: This directory, located within the `junit5-tutorial` directory, contains Java source code files. These files represent my own implementations to the examples presented in the lecture.
    - `pom.xml`: The `pom.xml` file is a Maven Project Object Model (POM) file used for managing dependencies and build configurations for the project.
  - `Chapter X Quiz.txt`: A text file corresponding to the quiz for the lecture. These files contain my responses to the quiz questions.

## Usage

You can explore my code implementations and quiz solutions by navigating to the specific chapter and associated directories within the repository. Each quiz text file contains my quiz answers.

Feel free to use these code implementations as reference code, study materials, or review materials to enhance your understanding of JUnit 5. Additionally, you can review my quiz solutions to reinforce your knowledge of the course content.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have alternative code implementations, suggestions for improvements, or corrections to my answers, please consider submitting a pull request. If you encounter any issues with my solutions or have additional insights to share, please open an issue.
